              <p>For as long as I can recall, I've always stuck out like a sore thumb; thing is, though, that with a
                sense of creativity, that can become a skill-stretching exercise in difficult times. While I never
                really felt a belonging anywhere for most of my life, I've always had my vast imagination to come back
                to.</p>

              <p>The beauty about imagination is that it can help you escape the more difficult aspects of life.
                Imagination and reality, however, has always been a difficult balancing act for me - but when you
                don't feel like you have a place you can fit into, what options do you realistically have that don't
                kill a part of your soul? Well, along the way, I've learned ways to sometimes weave reality and
                creativity together - but it's required constant journeys off the beaten track. Bush whacking into
                guinea pig programs, self-directed projects, group exchanges and world travel, I've regularly woven
                out unique ways to help me through.</p>

              <p>These experiences have always taught me amazing things - while sometimes traumatizing me in the
                process. After overdosing on ventures out into the world, at one point I hit a wall. Everything I'd
                been through up until that point came crashing in, and there was no stopping it. Burnt out and
                paralyzed by trauma, I was forced to give the journey a break for a year - which happened to hit 2
                months before covid.</p>

              <div class="color-2">
                <p>Moving forwards, I decided that I had to weave my reality in a more self directed and
                  behind-the-scenes
                  manner. After enthusiastically trodding out into the unknown for years, I now needed something that
                  wasn't
                  going to be a surprise. While pondering the possibilities of dusting off my writing skills, I had a
                  light
                  bulb moment during a conversation with my former boss - the only thing I was missing that would help
                  was
                  multimedia skills! It was at this point that I knew my next step.</p>

                <p>In January of 2021, I started taking the Multimedia Communications Program at the YukonU. Immediately
                  feeling a connection with my instructor (and birthday buddy), Jon Gelinas, I knew this was the right
                  path
                  for me! While still burned out and navigating my mental health, I managed to attend the program
                  part-time
                  over the years.</p>

                <p>This program not only got me to slowly step back out into the real world again, but it also helped me
                  regain a sense of belonging with myself and my work. If it weren't for this experience, I never would
                  have
                  utilized my creative skills for digital design - something I've grown a strong appreciation for.</p>

                <p>In a cookie cutter world, if you're able to have a say in how it's designed, I think it's better than
                  not
                  having any say. Moving forwards, I'm hoping my skills in writing and design can help shape parts of
                  existence better, so that people like me don't always struggle to navigate a world that isn't built
                  for
                  us. If I can change even the tiniest thing to help others feel a sense of home in this world, I'll be
                  more
                  than content. Now that I've gained the skills necessary to weave parts of reality, it's time I find my
                  own
                  supplies and get to work.</p>

        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m an artist in many mediums, with a strong focus on expanding my work digitally. My paintings and poetry
          are
          collections from throughout my life, and my bronze work was made during a semester at the Kootenay Studio of
          Arts, back in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>In most of my art, I aim for detailed intention. Each symbol, shape, and word often tells a personal story,
          which I leave open for interpretation. I believe that expressing my life story through cryptic and abstract
          means can become cathartic for others in their own life, by allowing them to relate to specific phrases and
          symbols in my work.
